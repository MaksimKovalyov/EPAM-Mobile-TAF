What is Mobile TAF?
-------------------
It is a Test Automation Framework (TAF) for mobile applications. It is an effort by **EPAM Systems**.

Our solution:

* Flexible: high stability to changes of automation trends
* Cross-platform: possibility to write tests within various OS and use different tools or frameworks
* Well integrated: abstract layer intoduction - ability of test creation in different languages (full support of main programming languages)
* Full automation: test covering of all app layers and bindings (yes, it is impossible in some cases)
* Easy-to-use: an easy interface for working with the solution
* Easy-to-deploy: an easy environment support of DB, servers, build, web app, network, clouds, etc.
