* well integrated: abstract layer intoduction - ability of test creation in different languages (full support of main programming languages)
* full automation: test covering of all app layers and bindings (yes, it is impossible in some cases)
* easy-to-use: an easy interface for working with the solution
* easy-to-deploy: an easy environment support of DB, servers, build, web app, network, clouds, etc.
