Visualizer
==========
Description
-----------
This is a web-interface that complies with **EPAM Mobile TAF** (informally known as **TestAidKit**).

The core design pattern implemented in this application is a **module pattern**. It allows creating private variables and methods within object instances.

All possible unhandled errors are directed to the application log.

P.S. This is my first real-life web-application, so don't judge me strictly.

Architecture
------------
*Coming soon...*

Configuration
-------------
The attempt is taken to make the interface as user-friendly as possible. All of the UI controls are available by clicking the **\[?\]** button in the bottom right corner of the browser window.

Prerequisites
-------------
Browsers (recent versions): Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari.
